            <p>Hello, my name is Ben! I was born and raised in Idaho Falls, ID, and lived there until I was 18-years-old. I grew up on a small farm of about 13 acres and we raised alfalfa, a few cows, a horse, some goats, pigs, sheep, and several other animals. We kept a large garden and were pretty self-sufficient. </p>
            <p>When I was about 21 I moved to Utah to pursue a culinary career. I was going to attend culinary school in Park City, but I think I just needed a plan to justify dropping out of college in Idaho. That plan fell through, and I ended up working at a mortgage education company for almost 5 years. While in Utah, I met and married my amazing wife Colleen, and we currently live in South Salt Lake with our 4 cats, Ferguson, Archie, Posie, and Ollie. </p>
            <p>Recently, I started learning to code through a University of Utah-sponsored coding bootcamp. I am looking to change my career, increase my opportunities, and learn a new skill. I know the technology industry is not going anywhere soon, and I'm looking forward to being a part of it over the next several years.</p>
